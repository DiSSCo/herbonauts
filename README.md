# Les Herbonautes
The [Mus√©um national d'Histoire naturelle](https://www.mnhn.fr/) and [Bluescale](http://www.bluescale.com/) developped [Les Herbonautes](http://lesherbonautes.mnhn.fr/) to allow the public to engage in unlocking scientific collections data, following the mass digitization of the French National Herbarium.
The citizen science platform invite users to transcribe the text from specimen image stored on the [ReColNat platform](https://www.recolnat.org/en/) into dedicated fields. Metadata produced are later transfered into the institutions database through. Specimens images to transcribe are gather in batches called "mission" by the mission managers, each user having to subscribe to a mission. The same image will be submitted randomly to several users for validation of the inputed data.
